# CRP Dashboard Routing Fix

## Problem

The CRP Dashboard was using local state management (`activeTab`) instead of proper URL routing. When users clicked "CRP Dashboard", the component would load but the URL wouldn't change, causing navigation and browser history issues.

## Solution

Updated the CRP Dashboard to use proper React Router navigation:

### 🔧 Changes Made

1. **Added CRP Route to LazyRouter**

   ```typescript
   // Added CRP Dashboard route in LazyRouter.tsx
   const CRPDashboard = lazyWithRetry(() => import('../crp/CRPDashboard'));

   // Added routes:
   { path: '/crp-dashboard', component: CRPDashboard },
   { path: '/customer-retention', component: CRPDashboard }, // Alternative route
   ```

2. **Updated Navigation Logic**

   ```typescript
   // Before: Using local state
   setActiveTab('crp-dashboard');

   // After: Using React Router navigation
   navigate('/crp-dashboard');
   ```

3. **Updated All CRP Click Handlers**
   - CRP Dashboard button in banner
   - CRP card in stats grid
   - CRP tab in navigation
   - Debug panel force button

### 🚀 Benefits

- **URL Changes**: Now when you click CRP Dashboard, the URL changes to `/crp-dashboard`
- **Browser History**: Back/forward buttons work properly
- **Direct Links**: You can bookmark and share direct links to CRP Dashboard
- **Better UX**: Proper navigation experience matching web standards

### 🔗 Available Routes

- `/crp-dashboard` - Main CRP Dashboard route
- `/customer-retention` - Alternative route for CRP Dashboard
- Both routes load the same `CRPDashboard` component

### 🧪 Testing

1. Click any CRP Dashboard button/card
2. Verify URL changes to `/crp-dashboard`
3. Use browser back button - should work properly
4. Refresh page on `/crp-dashboard` - should load CRP directly
5. Direct navigation to `/crp-dashboard` should work

### 📝 Notes

- The local tab state is still used for other tabs (Customers, Contacts, Files, Forms)
- Only CRP Dashboard now uses proper routing
- Console debug logs show navigation events for debugging
- The EVA chat issue was separate from routing and has been resolved

### 🔄 Migration Path

If you want to add proper routing to other tabs in the future:

1. Add routes to `LazyRouter.tsx`
2. Update click handlers to use `navigate()`
3. Remove local `activeTab` state management
4. Update URL patterns to match business requirements
