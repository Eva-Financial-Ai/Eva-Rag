# KPI Framework Implementation Status Update

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED: Import Error Fixed

### Problem

The KPI service was failing to compile due to a missing import:

```
ERROR in src/services/kpiService.ts:20:26
TS2307: Cannot find module '../types/auth' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

### Solution

Fixed the import path in `src/services/kpiService.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
import { UserRole } from '../types/auth';

// After (correct)
import { UserRole } from '../hooks/useUserPermissions';
```

### Verification

- ‚úÖ **Build Success**: `npm run build` completes without TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ **Development Server**: Application starts successfully
- ‚úÖ **Core Functionality**: KPI framework loads and displays correctly

## üéØ Current Implementation Status
