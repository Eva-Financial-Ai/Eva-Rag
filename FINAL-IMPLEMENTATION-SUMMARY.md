## 🔧 **Backend Implementation Details**

### **File Structure:**

```

├── types/
│   ├── ragTypes.ts                    # Enhanced with storage limits
│   └── cloudflareR2Types.ts           # New: R2 integration types
├── services/

```

### **Backend Integration Flow:**

```typescript
// 1. User selects economical model
setSelectedModel('eva-nemotron-7b');

// 2. Backend automatically detects need for R2
if (modelId === 'eva-nemotron-7b' && !r2Config) {
  setNeedsR2Setup(true); // Shows setup notice
}

// 3. User clicks "Setup Storage" → R2 wizard opens
// 4. API key validation → Auto RAG setup → Connection test
// 5. Backend stores config and enables custom uploads
```
