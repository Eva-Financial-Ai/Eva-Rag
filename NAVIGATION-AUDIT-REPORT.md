## 🐛 Why You Might Not See Updates

### 1. Server Not Running ❌

**Solution**:

```bash
npm start
```

**Status**: ✅ Server started during audit

### 2. Browser Cache 🔄

**Issue**: Browser showing cached version
**Solution**: Hard refresh

- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### 3. Navigation Not Expanded 📁

**Issue**: New sections are collapsible and may appear collapsed
**Solution**: Click on navigation items to expand submenus

### 4. Feature Flags 🚩

**Issue**: Some items might be hidden by feature flags
**Solution**: Check feature flag configuration in `src/config/featureFlags.ts`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Verify Server is Running

```bash
# Check if server is accessible
curl -I http://localhost:3000

# If not running, start it
npm start
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Or use keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

### Step 3: Check Console for Errors

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for JavaScript errors (red text)
4. Check Network tab for failed resource loads

### Step 4: Use Debug Script

Copy and paste this code in browser console:

```javascript
// Quick navigation debug
const navItems = document.querySelectorAll('nav ul li');
console.log(`Found ${navItems.length} navigation items`);

['Products & Services', 'Smart Matching', 'Term Request Details'].forEach(item => {
  const found = Array.from(navItems).find(li => li.textContent?.includes(item));
  console.log(`${item}: ${found ? '✅ FOUND' : '❌ NOT FOUND'}`);
});
```

### Step 5: Test Navigation Functionality

1. Click on "Credit Application" to expand submenu
2. Verify "Term Request Details" appears as 6th item
3. Click on "Products & Services" to expand
4. Click on "Smart Matching" to expand
5. Test clicking individual menu items
