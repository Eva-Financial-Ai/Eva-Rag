### Data Source Configuration

Each data source has specific requirements:

| Data Source      | Refresh Rate | Authentication        | Primary Use Cases               |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Stripe           | 5 minutes    | API Key               | Payments, commissions, revenue  |
| QuickBooks       | 1 hour       | OAuth 2.0             | Financial statements, cash flow |
| Plaid            | 30 minutes   | API Key + Link Token  | Banking, transactions           |
| Equifax          | 24 hours     | API Key + Certificate | Personal credit scores          |
| TransUnion       | 24 hours     | API Key + OAuth       | Business credit scores          |
| Experian         | 24 hours     | API Key               | Credit profiles                 |
| PayNet           | 12 hours     | API Key + OAuth       | Commercial credit, risk         |
| Google Analytics | 15 minutes   | OAuth 2.0             | User behavior, engagement       |
| Xero             | 1 hour       | OAuth 2.0             | Alternative accounting          |
| NetSuite         | 1 hour       | OAuth 2.0 + Token     | Enterprise accounting           |

### API Endpoints Required

The comprehensive backend implementation guide (`KPI-DATA-SOURCES-README.md`) provides:

- Detailed endpoint specifications for each data source
- Data transformation examples
- Error handling patterns
- Caching strategies
- Security considerations
- Testing approaches

## üöÄ Production Readiness

### üìù Next Steps for Backend Team

1. **Implement API endpoints** as specified in the data sources guide
2. **Set up data source integrations** with proper authentication
3. **Implement caching strategy** based on refresh rates
4. **Add monitoring and alerting** for API health
5. **Test with real data** from each integration

## üéâ Benefits of Simplified Approach

### For Development Team

- **Easier to maintain**: Fewer moving parts and abstractions
- **Faster implementation**: Clear data source requirements
- **Better performance**: Simplified calculations and caching
- **Clearer debugging**: Direct mapping from data source to KPI

### For Users

- **Faster loading**: Streamlined data processing
- **More reliable**: Based on actual integrations we have
- **Better understanding**: Clear data source attribution
- **Practical insights**: Metrics that directly relate to business operations

### For Backend Engineers

- **Clear requirements**: Specific endpoints and data points needed
- **Realistic scope**: Based on existing integrations
- **Practical examples**: Code samples for each KPI calculation
- **Comprehensive guide**: Complete implementation documentation

## üìä Sample KPI Display

Each KPI now shows:

- **Metric Value**: Formatted appropriately (currency, percentage, etc.)
- **Change Indicator**: Month-over-month change with trend arrows
- **Data Source Badge**: Color-coded badge showing which integration provides the data
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of last data refresh
- **Description**: Tooltip explaining what the metric measures

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. **Backend APIs** fetch data from integrated services (Stripe, QuickBooks, etc.)
2. **KPI Service** processes and calculates metrics
3. **Dashboard Component** displays KPIs with proper formatting
4. **Export Service** allows users to download data in CSV/JSON formats
5. **Caching Layer** optimizes performance based on data source refresh rates

## üéØ Summary

The simplified KPI framework is now **production-ready** and provides:

- **Complete coverage** of all role types (Borrower, Vendor, Broker, Lender)
- **Real data integration** with 10 actual services we use
- **Practical implementation** that backend engineers can easily build
- **Clean architecture** that's maintainable and scalable
- **User-friendly interface** with clear data source attribution

The framework successfully balances **functionality with simplicity**, providing valuable business insights while being practical to implement and maintain. Backend engineers now have a clear roadmap for implementation with specific endpoints, data points, and code examples for each KPI.

**Next Phase**: Ready to begin vendor user type specific enhancements once backend implementation is complete.
