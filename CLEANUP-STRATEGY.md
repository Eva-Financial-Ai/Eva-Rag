# Codebase Cleanup Strategy

This document outlines our strategy for cleaning up the codebase to make it more efficient and maintainable.

## 1. Remove Unused Imports and Variables

The codebase has many unused imports and variables that create unnecessary overhead. We'll address this by:

- Running our `fix-unused-imports.sh` script to automatically remove unused imports
- Manually reviewing complex files that automated tools can't fix

## 2. Remove Unused Components

Several components are defined but never used throughout the application. We'll:

- Identify and remove unused component files
- Update component imports in surviving files
- Ensure no regressions occur by running tests after removal

## 3. Optimize Dependencies

Our dependency tree includes many packages that might not be necessary. We'll:

- Review and remove unnecessary dependencies
- Update outdated dependencies
- Consider replacing heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives

## 4. Bundle Size Optimization

To reduce the bundle size, we will:

- Implement code splitting for large components
- Lazy load components that aren't needed immediately
- Optimize image assets and other static files

## 5. Standardize Code Patterns

To improve maintainability, we'll:

- Establish and enforce consistent coding patterns
- Standardize component structure
- Improve type safety throughout the codebase

## 6. Improve Performance

We'll focus on performance enhancements by:

- Optimizing render performance
- Reducing unnecessary re-renders
- Implementing memoization where appropriate

## Implementation Priority

1. Fix unused imports (immediate)
2. Remove unused components (high priority)
3. Optimize dependencies (medium priority)
4. Bundle size optimization (medium priority)
5. Code pattern standardization (ongoing)
6. Performance improvements (ongoing)

Each step will include testing to ensure no regressions are introduced.
