## Psychological Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Color Psychology for Financial Services**

- **Green**: Universally associated with money, growth, and "go"
- **Blue**: Trust, security, and professionalism in financial contexts
- **Orange**: Creates urgency without aggression, encourages action
- **Purple**: Premium feel, suggests exclusive/high-value services
- **Gold**: Wealth, prosperity, success indicators

### 2. **Visual Hierarchy Psychology**

- **Size & Contrast**: Important actions are larger and higher contrast
- **Animation**: Subtle movements draw attention to key actions
- **Spacing**: Generous white space reduces cognitive load
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy guides user attention flow

### 3. **Behavioral Triggers**

- **Progress Indicators**: Show completion status to encourage finishing
- **Success States**: Immediate positive feedback for actions
- **Scarcity Indicators**: Subtle urgency without pressure
- **Trust Signals**: Security badges, success indicators

### 4. **Accessibility & Inclusivity**

- **High Contrast**: Ensures visibility for all users
- **Focus States**: Clear keyboard navigation
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels
