## üß† Customer-EVA Conversation Protocol

### Phase 1: Customer Selection
When you select a customer from the top navigation:
- EVA receives full customer profile automatically
- Customer financial data, credit score, and transaction history are loaded
- User type is detected for response style adaptation

### Phase 2: Goal Setting
EVA will ask: **"What's the end goal of this conversation?"**

Example responses:
- "Review loan application for approval"
- "Assess risk factors for this customer"
- "Help customer understand loan options"
- "Evaluate portfolio performance"

### Phase 3: Resource Assessment
EVA will ask: **"What resources are available to achieve this goal?"**

Example responses:
- "I have access to credit reports, tax returns, and bank statements"
- "Internal underwriting tools and risk models are available"
- "Customer provided financial documents yesterday"
- "I need this completed within 2 business days"

### Phase 4: Summary & Confirmation
EVA provides a complete summary including:
- Customer context and financial profile
- Your stated goal
- Available resources
- Planned approach and response style

Respond with:
- **"Yes"** to continue with the plan
- **"No, [corrections]"** to modify the approach

### Phase 5: Active Chat
Once confirmed, EVA provides:
- Customer-specific recommendations
- Role-appropriate guidance
- Contextual tool suggestions
- Compliance-aware responses
