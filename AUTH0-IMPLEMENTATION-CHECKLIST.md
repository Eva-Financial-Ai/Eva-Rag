## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 99.9% authentication availability
- [ ] <2 second login time
- [ ] Zero unauthorized access incidents
- [ ] 100% correct role assignments

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Reduced clicks to access dashboard
- [ ] Decreased support tickets for access issues
- [ ] Improved user satisfaction scores

## Risk Mitigation

### Contingency Plans
1. **Auth0 Outage**: Implement cached authentication for limited functionality
2. **Rule Failures**: Default to most restrictive role (borrower)
3. **Token Issues**: Implement robust refresh token logic
4. **Migration Problems**: Keep legacy auth available via feature flag

### Rollback Procedures
1. Enable user type selector via feature flag
2. Switch to legacy authentication if needed
3. Maintain user session continuity
4. Document all issues for resolution
