# Risk Map QA Tests

## ⚠️ Important Setup Requirements

Before working with this codebase, please ensure you follow these critical setup steps:

1. **Use the correct Node.js version**
   ```bash
   # Install and use Node.js 18.18.0 (required)
   nvm install 18.18.0
   nvm use 18.18.0
   ```

2. **Run the setup script after cloning**
   ```bash
   # Run the mandatory setup script from project root
   ./setup-team-clone.sh
   ```

3. **Start the application with the recommended scripts**
   ```bash
   # Preferred: Start without ESLint checking (fastest)
   npm run start:no-lint
   
   # Alternative: Start with compatibility flags
   npm run start:force
   ```

**IMPORTANT**: Skipping these steps will result in errors when running the application.
