# Cloud Storage Integration

## ⚠️ Important Setup Requirements

Before working with this codebase, please ensure you follow these critical setup steps:

1. **Use the correct Node.js version**
   ```bash
   # Install and use Node.js 18.18.0 (required)
   nvm install 18.18.0
   nvm use 18.18.0
   ```

2. **Run the setup script after cloning**
   ```bash
   # Run the mandatory setup script from project root
   ./setup-team-clone.sh
   ```

3. **Start the application with the recommended scripts**
   ```bash
   # Preferred: Start without ESLint checking (fastest)
   npm run start:no-lint
   
   # Alternative: Start with compatibility flags
   npm run start:force
   ```

**IMPORTANT**: Skipping these steps will result in errors when running the application.

# Cloud Storage Integration for FileLock

This feature allows users to import documents from major cloud storage providers directly into the EVA platform's FileLock system.

## Supported Cloud Storage Providers

- **Google Drive**: Import documents from Google Drive
- **Microsoft OneDrive**: Import documents from OneDrive
- **Apple iCloud**: Import documents from iCloud

## Authentication & Authorization

The integration uses the platform's single sign-on (SSO) authentication system to securely access cloud storage providers. This means:

1. Users don't need to enter separate credentials for each cloud service
2. The application requests only the minimum necessary permissions
3. Access tokens are securely managed and refreshed as needed

## Implementation Details

### Components

- **CloudStorageConnector**: Main modal component for browsing and selecting files from cloud storage
- **CloudStorageService**: Service that handles API communications with cloud storage providers
- **AIDocumentAssistant**: Component that showcases EVA's ability to work with imported files
- **FileChatPanel**: Enhanced to recognize and provide context about cloud-imported files

### Flow

1. User clicks "Import from Cloud" in FileExplorer or AI Document Assistant
2. CloudStorageConnector modal opens
3. User selects a cloud storage provider to connect with
4. OAuth flow authenticates with the provider
5. User browses and selects files to import
6. Selected files are downloaded and imported into FileLock
7. Files retain metadata about their cloud storage source

## Conversation with EVA about Cloud-Imported Documents

EVA AI is enhanced to understand the context of cloud-imported documents. When chatting about these documents, EVA can:

1. Acknowledge the document's cloud storage origin
2. Provide additional context about import status
3. Answer questions about cloud storage permissions
4. Perform the same analysis functions as with any other document

## Security Considerations

- All cloud storage access is read-only
- Files are securely transferred using encrypted connections
- No cloud credentials are stored in the application
- Cloud access tokens are temporarily stored in memory only
- Single sign-on integration provides secure authentication

## Future Enhancements

- Bidirectional sync with cloud storage providers
- Automatic sync of specified folders
- Version tracking between FileLock and cloud storage versions
- Enhanced metadata preservation during imports

## Testing

To test the cloud storage integration:

1. Ensure you have an active account with at least one of the supported cloud providers
2. Navigate to FileLock Drive in the EVA platform
3. Click "Import from Cloud" to open the connector
4. Select a provider and authenticate
5. Browse and select files to import
6. Verify that imports complete successfully
7. Open an imported file and click "Chat with EVA" to test cloud-aware conversation

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Authentication failures**: Ensure your SSO account has been linked to the cloud provider
- **Import failures**: Check file size limits and supported file types
- **Missing metadata**: Some document properties may not be preserved during import
- **Conversation issues**: Try referencing the document's cloud source explicitly in your question
