## Implementation in the UI

### Accessing Team Management

2. Toggle between "Classic View" and "Tiered View"
3. In Tiered View, select your organization type

### Managing Team Members

1. **Adding Members**

   - Click "Add Team Member" (only visible if you have authority)
   - Select appropriate tier (only tiers below yours are available)
   - Fill in member details and send invitation

2. **Promoting/Demoting**

   - Use arrow buttons next to team members
   - Can only promote to tiers below your own
   - Demotion follows same restrictions

3. **Viewing Permissions**
   - Click on any tier to expand and see members
   - Permission badges show monetary limits and restrictions
   - Lock icon indicates tiers you cannot manage

### Visual Indicators

  - Green ($): Monetary authority

## Business Logic Examples

### Example 1: Loan Application Process (Borrower)

1. **Tier 4** (Accounting) uploads financial statements
2. **Tier 3** (Controller) creates $800K loan application
3. **Tier 2** (CFO) reviews and approves (within $5M limit)
4. **Tier 1** (CEO) provides final signature

### Example 2: Large Equipment Sale (Vendor)

1. **Tier 5** (Junior Sales) identifies opportunity
2. **Tier 4** (Senior Sales) prepares $400K quote
3. **Tier 3** (Sales Manager) approves with 8% discount
4. **Tier 2** (Sales Director) signs off on special terms

### Example 3: Loan Underwriting (Lender)

1. **Tier 4** (Analyst) performs initial review
2. **Tier 3** (Underwriter) approves $1.5M loan
3. For $3M loan: escalates to **Tier 2** (Senior Underwriter)
4. For $15M loan: requires **Tier 1** (CCO) approval

## Security Considerations

### Segregation of Duties

- Document upload separated from approval
- Multiple tiers required for critical operations
- Audit trail for all tier-based decisions

### Access Controls

- Time-based restrictions enforced at API level
- Geographic limits checked on each request
- Monetary limits validated before processing

### Compliance Features

- All role changes logged with timestamp
- Approval chains documented
- Regular access reviews required

## API Integration

### Checking Permissions

```typescript
import { canPerformAction } from '@/types/teamRoles';

// Check if user can approve a $3M loan
const canApprove = canPerformAction(userTier, 'lender', 'loan_approval', 3000000);
```

### Getting Approvers

```typescript
import { getApproversForAction } from '@/types/teamRoles';

// Find who can approve a $5M transaction
const approverTiers = getApproversForAction('borrower', 'loan_application', 5000000);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**

   - Quarterly tier assignment reviews
   - Annual permission audits
   - Monitor for privilege creep

2. **Onboarding**

   - Start new employees at appropriate tier
   - Gradual promotion based on performance
   - Document all tier changes

3. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Temporary tier elevation process
   - Emergency approval chains
   - Audit all emergency actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot manage this tier"**

   - You're trying to manage someone at or above your tier
   - Solution: Request action from higher tier

2. **"Action requires approval"**

   - Transaction exceeds your monetary limit
   - Solution: Submit for higher tier approval

3. **"Access restricted outside business hours"**
   - Time-based restriction in effect
   - Solution: Wait for allowed hours or request exception

### Support

For questions about tier assignments or permissions:

- Contact your organization's Tier 1 or Tier 2 manager
- Submit a support ticket with your current tier and requested action
- Include business justification for any exception requests
