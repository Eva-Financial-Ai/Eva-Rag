# Chunk Loading Error Fix

## Problem

You were encountering a `ChunkLoadError` when trying to access the Deal Structuring page:

```
ERROR
Loading chunk src_pages_DealStructuring_tsx failed.
(error: http://localhost:3000/static/js/src_pages_DealStructuring_tsx.chunk.js)
ChunkLoadError
```

## Root Cause

The development server wasn't running. The application uses code splitting with `@loadable/component` to create separate chunks for each page, and these chunks are served by the webpack dev server. Without the server running, the browser couldn't load the required JavaScript chunks.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Started the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Created Error Boundary for Chunk Loading Errors

Created `src/components/common/ChunkLoadErrorBoundary.tsx` to gracefully handle chunk loading errors with:

- User-friendly error message
- Reload button to retry loading
- Go back button for navigation
- Technical details for debugging

### 3. Wrapped Router with Error Boundary

Updated `src/components/routing/LoadableRouter.tsx` to wrap all routes with the `ChunkLoadErrorBoundary` component.

## Prevention Tips

1. **Always ensure the dev server is running** before accessing the application
2. **Clear browser cache** if you see persistent chunk loading errors (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Clear webpack cache** if issues persist: `rm -rf node_modules/.cache`

## Quick Troubleshooting Script

A script was created at `fix-chunk-loading.sh` that:

- Checks if the dev server is running
- Provides troubleshooting steps
- Validates the component files exist

Run it with:

```bash
./fix-chunk-loading.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- The app uses lazy loading for better performance
- Each route component is loaded on-demand
- The error boundary will catch future chunk loading errors and provide a better user experience
