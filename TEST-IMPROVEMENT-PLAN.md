# Test Improvement Plan - Path to 80% Coverage

## Current State

- **Coverage**: ~0.73% (Target: 80%)
- **Key Issues**: ResizeObserver errors, low coverage, some failing tests
- **Goal**: Achieve 80% coverage with stable, maintainable tests

## Phase-by-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Test Infrastructure (1-2 prompts)

1. **Fix ResizeObserver for Recharts**

   - Create comprehensive Recharts mock
   - Update setupTests.ts with better polyfills
   - Ensure all chart-based components can be tested

2. **Fix BrowserRouter Reference Errors**
   - Ensure proper imports in all test files
   - Fix any remaining syntax/linter errors

### Phase 2: Core Component Testing (3-4 prompts)

Focus on high-value components that provide maximum coverage:

1. **Authentication & User Management** (10-15% coverage gain)

   - UserContext, Auth0Context
   - useUserPermissions hook
   - Permission guards and role-based access

2. **Core Business Logic** (15-20% coverage gain)

   - Transaction services
   - Risk assessment components
   - Credit application workflows
   - Document verification

3. **Data Services & API** (10-15% coverage gain)

   - API client and services
   - Mock data handlers
   - Error handling utilities

4. **Common Components** (10-15% coverage gain)
   - Button, Input, Modal, Form components
   - Layout components
   - Utility functions

### Phase 3: Dashboard & Analytics (2-3 prompts)

1. **Fix Dashboard Tests**

   - BorrowerAnalyticsDashboard
   - VendorAnalyticsDashboard
   - CEOExecutiveDashboard
   - EnhancedKPIDashboard

2. **Chart Components**
   - Mock all Recharts components
   - Test data transformations
   - Test user interactions

### Phase 4: Integration & E2E Tests (2-3 prompts)

1. **Critical User Flows**

   - Loan application process
   - Document upload and verification
   - Risk assessment workflow
   - Payment processing

2. **Cross-Component Integration**
   - Navigation flows
   - State management
   - Real-time updates

### Phase 5: Optimization & Cleanup (1-2 prompts)

1. **Performance**

   - Reduce test execution time
   - Optimize mock data
   - Parallel test execution

2. **Maintainability**
   - Remove console warnings
   - Update deprecated APIs
   - Document test patterns

## Estimated Timeline

- **Total Prompts Needed**: 10-15 prompts
- **Coverage Progression**:
  - Phase 1: 0.73% → 5%
  - Phase 2: 5% → 40%
  - Phase 3: 40% → 60%
  - Phase 4: 60% → 80%
  - Phase 5: Optimization

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage Targets**

   - Statements: ≥80%
   - Branches: ≥75%
   - Functions: ≥80%
   - Lines: ≥80%

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Zero flaky tests
   - <30s total test execution
   - Clear error messages
   - Maintainable test code

## Customer Satisfaction Focus

1. **Reliability**: Tests catch real bugs before production
2. **Speed**: Fast feedback loop for developers
3. **Clarity**: Easy to understand test failures
4. **Confidence**: High coverage of critical paths
5. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Fix ResizeObserver mock for Recharts
2. Create reusable test utilities
3. Start with highest-impact components
4. Build incrementally with each prompt
