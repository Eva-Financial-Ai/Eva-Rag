# Analysis of Potentially Unused Components

This analysis categorizes the identified unused components into three groups:

## 1. Likely Genuinely Unused (Safe to Remove)

These components appear to be genuinely unused in the application, likely because:
- They were created for features that were never fully implemented
- They were replaced by newer components
- They were part of experimental features that were abandoned

Components in this category:
- ThirdPartyAuthModal, DocumentUploadModal, PlaidLinkModal, StripeConnectModal (integration modals that may have been replaced)
- MyPortfolioWallet, PyPortfolioWallet (likely experimental implementations)
- CreditAnalysisChatInterface, AIChatAdvisor (likely replaced by EVA AI assistant integration)
- BlockchainTransactionViewer, BlockchainButton, PortfolioDropdown, UniCurrency (blockchain features that might not have been fully integrated)
- FundingTrendsChart, MetricCard, DealProgressCard (analytics components that might have been replaced)

## 2. Potentially Needed But Not Properly Wired Up

These components might still be relevant to your system but aren't properly imported or used in the codebase. They could be:
- Components that should be used but aren't properly imported
- Recently developed components not yet integrated
- Components imported dynamically or conditionally that our detection script missed

Components in this category:
- DocumentRequestTracker, DocumentRequestModal, DocumentList, DocumentComparisonViewer (core document management features)
- RiskMetricsDisplay, RiskConfiguration, RiskAccordionItem (risk assessment features)
- CreditApplicationTabs, BankStatementVerification, CreditRiskAnalysis (credit assessment features)
- GlobalErrorBoundary (likely should be used for error handling)
- CustomerCard, ContactImport, CustomersTable (customer management features that should be in use)
- MainNavigation, MainLayout (layout components that should be in use)
- CreditScoreGauge, DynamicDashboard (dashboard components)

## 3. Development/Demo Components (Can Be Removed or Moved)

These components are likely for development, testing, or demonstration purposes and aren't meant for production:
- RouterSelector, PQCryptographyProvider (development utilities)
- ResponsiveTestingPanel, SideNavigationTest, PerformanceMonitor (testing components)
- DemoModeSwitcherPanel, DemoCreditsManager, DemoCreditsManagerFix (demo-specific components)
- RiskReportDevTools, UserStoriesView (development tooling)
- EVAAssistantWithCustomAgents (likely a demo or test version of the assistant)
- SmartMatchSkeleton, StructureEditorSkeleton (placeholders/skeletons for development)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **For Category 1 (Likely Unused)**: 
   These can be safely moved to the backup directory or removed.

2. **For Category 2 (Potentially Needed)**:
   - Review each component to understand its purpose
   - Check if there are newer components that replaced their functionality
   - Consider properly integrating any that should be used in the application

3. **For Category 3 (Development/Demo)**:
   - Move to a separate 'dev-components' directory instead of removing completely
   - Add clear documentation about their purpose
   - Consider adding a feature flag system to control their visibility

## Note on Detection Method

Our detection method has limitations:
- It only checks for static imports and basic JSX usage
- It doesn't account for dynamic imports via React.lazy() or import()
- It might miss components referenced via string literals or dynamic variables
- It doesn't check for components used in complex ways (HOCs, render props, etc.)

Before permanently removing components, verify each one's purpose and usage patterns.
