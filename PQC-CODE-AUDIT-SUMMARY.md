# PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) Code Audit Summary

## Date: January 9, 2025

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive search of the codebase, the following PQC-related code and documentation has been identified. The PQC feature has been **deferred to July-August 2025** according to the project timeline.

## PQC-Related Files Found

### 1. Documentation Files

#### Primary Documentation
- **`/PQC-IMPLEMENTATION-TIMELINE.md`** - Main timeline document outlining the deferred implementation schedule (July-August 2025)

#### Files Referencing PQC
- `/audit-reports/audit_20250526_115525/01_security_audit.md` - Security audit mentioning PQC
- `/AUTH0-SETUP.md` - Auth0 setup documentation with PQC references
- `/FEATURE-COMPLETION-STATUS-MAY-27-2025.md` - Feature status showing PQC as deferred
- `/FEATURE-IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md` - Tasks mentioning PQC implementation
- `/JUNE-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` - Release checklist noting PQC deferral
- `/PRODUCTION-READINESS-CHECKLIST.md` - Production checklist with PQC references

### 2. Component Documentation

#### `/src/components/blockchain/README.md`
- Line 128: References PQC integration with Security Service
- States: "Integrates with PQC for quantum-resistant security"

#### `/src/components/security/README.md`
- **This is the main PQC component documentation**
- Describes planned PQC security components:
  - `PQCryptographyProvider`
  - `PQCLogin`
  - `PQCTransactionVerification`
- Details NIST-standardized algorithms (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
- Provides implementation examples and usage patterns

### 3. Code References

#### `/src/components/document/TransactionExecution.tsx`
- Lines 847-852: Comment about "post-quantum cryptography verification"
- This appears to be a placeholder for future PQC integration

### 4. Navigation/Routes
- No active PQC routes found in navigation configuration
- Shield Vault exists at `/shield-vault` but contains no PQC implementation

## Notable Findings

### 1. No Actual PQC Implementation
- **No PQC components exist** in the codebase
- **No PQC services or utilities** implemented
- **No PQC types or interfaces** defined
- **No PQC API integrations** present

### 2. Documentation-Only State
- All PQC references are in documentation or comments
- The `/src/components/security/README.md` describes components that don't exist yet
- Implementation is fully deferred to July-August 2025

### 3. Related Components
- `/src/components/security/WrittenPasswordVerification.tsx` - Traditional password verification (not PQC)
- `/src/pages/ShieldVault.tsx` - Document escrow vault (no PQC features)

## Recommended Actions for Archival

### Files to Archive
1. `/PQC-IMPLEMENTATION-TIMELINE.md` - Primary timeline document
2. `/src/components/security/README.md` - PQC component specifications

### Code Cleanup Required
1. Remove PQC reference from `/src/components/blockchain/README.md` (line 128)
2. Remove/update PQC comment in `/src/components/document/TransactionExecution.tsx` (lines 847-852)
3. Update documentation files to remove PQC references:
   - All files listed in "Files Referencing PQC" section above

### No Component Removal Needed
- No actual PQC components exist to remove
- No imports or dependencies to clean up
- No routes or navigation items to remove

## Archive Strategy

Since PQC is deferred to July-August 2025, the recommended approach is:

1. **Create an archive directory**: `/archived/pqc-deferred-july-2025/`
2. **Move documentation**: Copy the two main PQC documents to archive
3. **Update references**: Remove or mark as deferred all PQC mentions in active documentation
4. **Add README**: Create an archive README explaining the deferral and future implementation plans

## Conclusion

The PQC feature exists only in documentation and planning stages. No actual code implementation has been started, making the archival process straightforward. The main task is updating documentation to clearly indicate the deferred status and removing placeholder references that might cause confusion.
