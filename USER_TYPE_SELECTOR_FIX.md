# User Type Selector Fix - Dashboard Information Not Updating

## Problem Identified ❌

When users selected a different user type from the dropdown in the top left corner of the dashboard, the dashboard information was not updating. The role selector appeared to work (showing the new role in the dropdown), but the dashboard content, metrics, and features remained the same as the previous role.

## Root Cause Analysis 🔍

The issue was caused by **disconnected user context systems**:

1. **Multiple Context Systems**: The application had multiple user context management systems that were not synchronized:

   - `UserContext` - Used by `RoleBasedDashboard` component
   - `UserTypeContext` - Used by `TopNavbar` component
   - Local state management in `DashboardLayout` component

2. **Incomplete Context Updates**: When user type selectors updated their respective contexts, they didn't update **all** context systems that components were listening to.

3. **Navigation Interference**: Some selectors tried to navigate to non-existent routes instead of updating the current dashboard in place.

## Components Affected 🔧

### 1. `DashboardLayout.tsx`

- **Issue**: `handleUserTypeSelect` only updated localStorage and called `onUserChange`, but didn't update the global `UserContext`
- **Fix**: Added `UserContext` update via `userContext.setUserRole(role)`

### 2. `TopNavbar.tsx`

- **Issue**: `handleUserTypeSelect` only updated `UserTypeContext`, not the `UserContext` that `RoleBasedDashboard` was listening to
- **Fix**: Added `UserContext` update via `setUserRole(roleString)`

### 3. `RoleBasedDashboard.tsx`

- **Status**: ✅ Already correctly implemented - was listening to `UserContext` and updating properly when role changed

## Fixes Implemented ✅

### Fix 1: DashboardLayout Context Synchronization

```typescript
const handleUserTypeSelect = (role: User['role']) => {
  localStorage.setItem('userRole', role);

  // ✅ NEW: Update the global UserContext
  if (userContext && userContext.setUserRole) {
    userContext.setUserRole(role);
  }

  // Create a new user object with the selected role
  const newUser: User = { ...user, role };

  // Call the onUserChange callback if provided
  if (onUserChange) {
    onUserChange(newUser);
  }

  setIsUserTypeDropdownOpen(false);

  // ✅ CHANGED: Don't navigate - let dashboard update in place
  // The RoleBasedDashboard will automatically re-render with new role data
};
```

### Fix 2: TopNavbar Context Synchronization

```typescript
const handleUserTypeSelect = (roleString: UserRoleTypeString) => {
  setSelectedUserTypeString(roleString);
  localStorage.setItem('userRole', roleString);
  userTypeContext.setUserType(mapStringToUserTypeEnum(roleString));

  // ✅ NEW: Also update the UserContext that RoleBasedDashboard uses
  setUserRole(roleString);

  const specificRolesForNewType = userTypeToRolesMap[roleString] || [roleString];
  const defaultSpecificRole = specificRolesForNewType[0];

  setSelectedSpecificRole(defaultSpecificRole);
  localStorage.setItem('specificRole', defaultSpecificRole);
  userTypeContext.setSpecificRole(defaultSpecificRole);

  // Dispatch custom event for role change
  window.dispatchEvent(new Event('roleChanged'));
  setIsUserRoleDropdownOpen(false);
};
```

## How It Works Now ✅

1. **User clicks role selector** in top navigation or dashboard layout
2. **Both context systems update**:
   - `UserTypeContext` gets updated (for TopNavbar and other components)
   - `UserContext` gets updated (for RoleBasedDashboard)
3. **RoleBasedDashboard detects the change** via its `useEffect` hook monitoring `userRole`
4. **Dashboard automatically updates**:
   - User profile switches to new role
   - Available features update based on role permissions
   - Metrics, stats, and charts regenerate for new role
   - UI reflects the new user type immediately

## Test Results ✅

- ✅ **Build Status**: 0 TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Context Synchronization**: All user context systems now update together
- ✅ **Dashboard Updates**: Role changes immediately reflect in dashboard content
- ✅ **No Navigation Issues**: Dashboard updates in place without route changes
- ✅ **Performance**: Uses existing React state management without additional complexity

## Benefits of This Fix 🎯

1. **Immediate User Feedback**: Dashboard content updates instantly when role is changed
2. **Consistent State**: All components now use synchronized user context
3. **Better UX**: No page reloads or navigation delays
4. **Maintainable**: Uses existing context patterns without architectural changes
5. **Robust**: Works across all user type selector components

## Verification Steps 🧪

To verify the fix works:

1. Open the dashboard (`/dashboard`)
2. Click the user type selector in the top left corner
3. Select a different role (e.g., switch from "Borrower" to "Lender")
4. **Expected Result**: Dashboard content should immediately update to show:
   - New role-specific features and navigation
   - Different metrics and statistics
   - Role-appropriate quick stats
   - Updated user profile information

The fix ensures that user type selection now properly synchronizes across all context systems, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.
