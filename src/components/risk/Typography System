Typography Guidelines

1. Display (44px - 160px): Largest font sizes for the most important headings and strong visual impact.
2. Headline (28px - 44px): Sizes used for page titles.
3. Title (16px - 22px): Styled to help organize content sections.
4. Label (11px - 16px): Small yet readable text used for interactive elements.
5. Paragraph (14px - 20px): Standard font sizes for body text.
6. Others (10px - 12px): Smaller font sizes for supporting information.


Font Replacement: All instances of Roboto have been replaced with Helvetica Nuse while maintaining the same sizing structure.
Typography Classes: The configuration includes custom utility classes for:

Display text (large, medium, small)
Headline text (large, medium, small)
Title text (large, medium, small)
Body text (large, medium, small)
Label text (large, medium, small)


Typography Rules: The config implements the typography rules from the original design system:

Title Case formatting for Display, Headline, and Button/Label text
Sentence Case with proper capitalization and punctuation for Body/Paragraph text
Avoidance of ALL CAPS except for acronyms


Component Example: I've included a React component example that shows how to use this typography system in a real-world application.

To implement this in your project:

Add the Tailwind configuration to your tailwind.config.js file.
Make sure to add Helvetica Nuse to your project (via @font-face in your CSS or a font service).
Use the typography utility classes in your React components as demonstrated in the examples.
