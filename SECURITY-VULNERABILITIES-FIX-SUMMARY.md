## **🛠️ TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED**

### **Major Updates (High Impact)**
```bash
# Updated core webpack dependencies to latest secure versions
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server@latest webpack@latest

# Result: Eliminated 17 high-severity vulnerabilities
# - Fixed braces, ip, node-forge, webpack-dev-middleware vulnerabilities
# - Removed 390 vulnerable packages, added 21 secure packages
```

### **Package Overrides (Targeted Security)**
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "postcss": "^8.4.31",
    "braces": "^3.0.3", 
    "nth-check": "^2.1.1",
    "resolve-url-loader": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

### **PostCSS Security (Development Only)**
```bash
# Added latest secure PostCSS as dev dependency
npm install postcss@^8.4.31 --save-dev

# Note: Remaining PostCSS vulnerability is nested in react-scripts
# Impact: Development environment only, not production
```
