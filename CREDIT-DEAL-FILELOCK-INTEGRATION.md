# Credit Application, Deal Structuring & FileLock Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated Credit Application, Deal Structuring, and FileLock components using an async pub/sub event system for seamless workflow transitions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Event Bus System (`EventBusService.ts`)
- Created a centralized pub/sub event system
- Supports async and sync event publishing
- Handles multiple event types:
  - `credit-application:*` events
  - `deal-structuring:*` events
  - `filelock:*` events
  - `workflow:*` events
  - `transaction:*` events

### 2. React Hook Integration (`useEventBus.ts`)
- `useEventSubscription` - Subscribe to events in components
- `useEventPublisher` - Publish events from components
- `useEventBus` - Combined hook for both operations

### 3. Component Updates

#### Credit Application
- Publishes `credit-application:submitted` when application is submitted
- Listens for `filelock:document-uploaded` events to update document status
- Automatically navigates to Deal Structuring after submission
- Passes transaction and application IDs through navigation state

#### Deal Structuring
- Receives navigation state from Credit Application
- Listens for `credit-application:submitted` events
- Publishes `deal-structuring:term-sheet-generated` when term sheet is created
- Listens for `filelock:document-signed` events
- Automatically updates workflow stage on key actions

#### FileLock Drive
- Accepts `transactionId` and `applicationId` props for context
- Publishes `filelock:document-uploaded` when files are uploaded
- Publishes `filelock:document-shared` when documents are shared
- Listens for `deal-structuring:term-sheet-generated` to auto-add term sheets
- Updates file list based on workflow events

#### EVA Multi-Chat Manager
- Creates contextual chat sessions based on workflow events
- Auto-creates sessions for credit applications and deal structuring
- Shows unread indicators when documents are uploaded
- Provides real-time assistance throughout the workflow

### 4. Demo Page (`IntegratedWorkflowDemo.tsx`)
- Showcases the complete integration flow
- Displays real-time event log
- Shows workflow status updates
- Demonstrates automatic navigation between components

## Usage

### Starting the Workflow
1. Navigate to `/integrated-workflow-demo`
2. Complete the Credit Application (75%+ progress)
3. Submit the application
4. System automatically navigates to Deal Structuring
5. Select deal options and generate term sheet
6. Documents are automatically synced to FileLock
7. All events are logged in real-time

### Event Flow Example
```javascript
// Credit Application submits
await creditApplicationEvents.submitApplication({
  id: 'APP-123',
  applicantName: 'John Doe',
  amount: 250000,
  status: 'submitted'
});

// Deal Structuring receives event and initiates
await dealStructuringEvents.initiateDeal({
  transactionId: 'TX-456',
  status: 'initiated'
});

// FileLock receives term sheet
await fileLockEvents.uploadDocument({
  documentId: 'DOC-789',
  documentName: 'Term_Sheet_TX-456.pdf',
  documentType: 'term_sheet',
  transactionId: 'TX-456'
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: Components communicate without tight coupling
2. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking event handling
3. **Workflow Continuity**: Automatic transitions between stages
4. **Real-time Updates**: All components stay synchronized
5. **Contextual Awareness**: Each component knows its role in the workflow
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new components to the workflow

## Future Enhancements

1. Add persistence for event history
2. Implement event replay for debugging
3. Add more granular event types
4. Create visual workflow builder
5. Add event filtering and routing rules
