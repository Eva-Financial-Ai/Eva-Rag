# üöÄ EVA AI Platform - Team Setup Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Clean Installation Required

**This repository has been completely migrated from CRACO to Vite.** If you previously cloned this repository, you MUST follow the clean installation steps below to avoid conflicts with old CRACO dependencies.

## üßπ Clean Installation Steps

### 1. Remove Old Repository (if exists)
```bash
# If you have an existing clone, remove it completely
rm -rf eva-mvp-fe
rm -rf eva-mvp-fe-*
```

### 2. Fresh Clone
```bash
# Clone the repository fresh
git clone https://github.com/Eva-Financial-Ai/eva-mvp-fe.git
cd eva-mvp-fe

# Switch to development branch (recommended)
git checkout development
```

### 3. Clean Install Dependencies
```bash
# Remove any existing node_modules and lock files
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Fresh install
npm install

# If you encounter peer dependency issues:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 4. Verify Vite Configuration
```bash
# Check that you have the correct package.json scripts
grep -A 5 '"scripts"' package.json

# You should see Vite commands like:
# "dev": "NODE_ENV=development REACT_APP_DEMO_MODE=true REACT_APP_BYPASS_AUTH=true vite --open"
# "build": "tsc && vite build"
```

### 5. Start Development Server
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# The app should open at http://localhost:5173
# NOT port 3000 (that was the old CRACO setup)
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Port 3000 is already in use"

lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Issue: "CRACO command not found"

**Solution**: Ensure you have the latest `src/config/environment.ts` file with proper interfaces.

### Issue: Navigation looks broken
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and ensure you're on the latest commit.
