# EVA AI Frontend Build Error Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to address build errors and TypeScript issues in the EVA AI frontend application.

## 1. React Refresh Runtime Errors

### 1.1 Issue
Multiple "Module not found" errors for files trying to import react-refresh/runtime from outside the src directory.

### 1.2 Fixes Applied
1. **Removed problematic imports from craco.config.js**
   - Removed all react-refresh/runtime alias configurations that were causing issues
   - Set devServer.hot to false to disable Fast Refresh completely

2. **Created a symlink in src/node_modules**
   - Created a symlink to react-refresh from the project's node_modules directory inside src/node_modules
   - This makes imports of react-refresh available within the src directory boundary

## 2. TypeScript Issues

### 2.1 API Service Storage Issue
Fixed TypeScript error: "Cannot invoke an object which is possibly undefined" in apiService.ts.

```typescript
// Added type assertion to fix the error
(cachedAxios.storage as any).remove(url);
(cachedAxios.storage as any).clear();
```

### 2.2 ErrorBoundary Error Info Type
Fixed TypeScript error with handleError function parameter type in GlobalErrorBoundary.tsx.

```typescript
// Changed
import React from 'react';
const handleError = (error: Error, info: { componentStack: string }) => {...}

// To 
import React, { ErrorInfo } from 'react';
const handleError = (error: Error, info: ErrorInfo) => {...}
```

### 2.3 Missing Type Declaration for lodash.debounce
Created a type declaration file for lodash.debounce to resolve "could not find a declaration file" error:
- Created src/types/lodash.debounce.d.ts with proper type definitions

### 2.4 CreditAnalysisChatInterface Type Issues
Fixed several type issues in CreditAnalysisChatInterface.tsx:

1. Created a proper type for message attachments:
```typescript
type MessageAttachmentType = {
  name: string;
  type: string;
  size: number;
  url: string;
};
```

2. Created an enhanced Transaction type to handle custom properties:
```typescript
interface EnhancedTransaction extends Transaction {
  debtType?: string;
  financialData?: any;
  collateralInfo?: any;
  guarantorInfo?: any;
}
```

## 3. Overall Strategy

Our approach to fixing these issues followed these principles:

1. **Minimize Config Changes**: We made targeted changes to craco.config.js to remove problematic configurations
2. **Use Type Assertions Sparingly**: We used type assertions only where necessary for external libraries
3. **Proper Type Definitions**: We created proper type interfaces for objects used in the application
4. **Filesystem Solutions**: Created a symlink to provide access to node_modules from the src directory

These fixes maintain the scalability improvements we previously implemented while resolving the compile-time errors.
